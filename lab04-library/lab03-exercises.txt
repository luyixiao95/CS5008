1.Each tool used in the lab

1) extern: to remind the compiler that the parammeter is defined out of this file, and it can link with the this file after compiling.

2) objdump: is using on compiling documents and is to display information of the object. Among them, -t is to print the dynamic symbol table of the document.

3) shared object files(.so): Is used as library to link to any fils in the run-time. In this lab, it used to link the lottory.o file and the hacker file

4) nm is a tool to see the lists from the files.

5)ldd fool is to help find out the error in the linking process.

6) LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable to reset the library at certain path.

7) gcc -shared -fPIC hack.c -o libhack.so: compile the hack.c as a shared library with independent code

8) export LD_PRELOAD=$pwd/libhack.so lotto: let the LD_PRELOAD environment variable export the libhack.so

9) echo $LD_PRELOAD to check the environment variable that was set.

10) unset LD_PRELOAD to clear the setting of environment variable


Still a lot questions remained


2. Advantage: it can save our compiling time and once there are some problems in one file, it can be solved in a quicker way.

Disadvantage: Everyone who can get into the library can change it so it faces some security problems.
