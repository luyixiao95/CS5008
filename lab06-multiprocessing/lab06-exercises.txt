1. There are 48 CPUs and each CPU has 12 cores in the Khory Machine

2.There might be memory leak because the memory is set to heap before fork, so after forking, two processes all contains the heap memory, and only one part is freed.

3. There is no need to use lock as each thread returns in a unique address so even if there is a data race, it doesn't matter as the processes can return into the right address only once.
