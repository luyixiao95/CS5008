# Merge Sort

1. Using recursion method to implement merge sort the worst-case big-Oh complexity of merge sort is nlog(n) and the best-case big-Oh complexity is also nlog(n). It can be easily to prove the worst case, but for the best case, it still need to use devide and conquer way for the whole list.

2. Using iteration method to implement merge sort the worst and best case for big-Oh complexity are all nlog(n) as well.
